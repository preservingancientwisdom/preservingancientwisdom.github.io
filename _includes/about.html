          <strong>Preserving Ancient Wisdom</strong> is an initiative to document, archive, and share the invaluable knowledge of our ancestors. From traditional medicine and farming practices to oral storytelling, spiritual beliefs, local inventions, and tribal culture—we aim to bring everything under one digital roof 🌏.

        <h3 class="section-heading">Why We Started 📜</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          In today's fast-paced digital era, a lot of indigenous wisdom is fading away. Our goal is to capture these priceless practices and techniques before they disappear. Every folk tale, every native healing method, and every forgotten ritual deserves to be remembered—and learned from.
        </p>

        <h3 class="section-heading">Our Vision 🔭</h3>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We envision a world where ancient and modern knowledge coexist. A platform where researchers, locals, students, and enthusiasts can contribute and explore lost or lesser-known heritage. A digital library of humanity’s shared ancestral legacy.
